INFO: [Vivado-projutils-15] Please note that by default, the file path for the project source files were set wrt the 'origin_dir' variable in the
 generated script. When this script is executed from the output directory, these source files will be referenced wrt this 'origin_dir' path value.
 In case this script was later physically moved to a different directory, the 'origin_dir' value MUST be set manually in the script with the path
 relative to the new output directory to make sure that the source files are referenced correctly from the original project. You can also set the
 'origin_dir' automatically by setting the 'origin_dir_loc' variable in the tcl shell before sourcing this generated script. The 'origin_dir_loc'
 variable should be set to the path relative to the new output directory. Alternatively, if you are sourcing the script from the Vivado command line,
 then set the origin dir using '-tclargs --origin_dir <path>'. For example, 'vivado -mode tcl -source adder_prj2.tcl -tclargs --origin_dir ".."

WARNING: [Vivado-projutils-10] Found source(s) that were local or imported into the project. If this project is being source controlled, then
 please ensure that the project source(s) are also part of this source controlled data. The list of these local source(s) can be found in the generated script
